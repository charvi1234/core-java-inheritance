/*
Design a class Person and two sub classes Actor and Actress.
Every Actor will have a name, color, number_of_eyes and debut_year associated with him or her.
Supply each with a constructor that sets the Person data fields as described with given values and a method named toString() that returns a string that contains a complete description of the Actor.
